#Welcome!

Hi! My name's Patrick. I'm an Assistant Professor of Anesthesiology and Orthopedics at the University of Florida in Gainesville, FL.

Most of my profesional time is currently spent in research, thanks to support from the NIGMS (a part of the National Institutes of Health) in the form of a K23. This grant supports our research in applying machine learning classification strategies to forecast severe acute postoperative pain. When not researching, I get to work with a phenomenal team of anesthesiologists and surgeons at UFHealth as part of the Division of Regional Anesthesia & Perioperative Pain Medicine in the Dept of Anesthesiology.

This website is designed to serve as a testbed for some of our upcoming research projects. Here, we hope to extend some of our work in Markov Modeling to the web via iPython, pandas, iPython notebook, and d3.js.
